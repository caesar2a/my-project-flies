            Jeddah has long been a port city. Even before being designated the
            port city for Mecca, Jeddah was a trading hub for the region. In the
            19th century, goods such as mother-of-pearl, tortoise shells,
            frankincense, and spices were routinely exported from the city.
            Apart from this, many imports into the city were destined for
            further transit to the Suez, Africa, or Europe. Many goods passing
            through Jeddah could not even be found in the city or even in
            Arabia.All of the capitals of the Middle East and North Africa are
            within two hours flying distance of Jeddah, making it the second
            commercial center of the Middle East after Dubai.

              industrial city in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh, Jubail and Yanbu.</b
